	This project is about implementing some programs used in the early years of UNIX,
	the idea borns from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvDZLjaCJuw,
	where Brian Kernighan runs some programs in his computer in order to prove the
	unix capabilities.

	For sure i will not be using the assembler they used, but rather i will be
	using raw x86_64, which means i will not be allowed to link any libc function,
	only syscalls and stack.

	The reason for this project is to improve my assembly skills by testing how
	optimized and good code I can produce without any compiler help.
