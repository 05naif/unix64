	* idea:
		This project reimplements a small set of early UNIX-style
		userland programs in x86_64 assembly, under explicit
		historical and resource constraints, to study streaming program
		design, memory discipline, and compositional tooling

		The behavior and usage patterns are based on the series of commands
		demonstrated by Brian Kernighan in the AT&T Bell Laboratories film:

		“UNIX: Making Computers Easier To Use” (1982 archive film),

	* program constraints:
		1. Each program must fall within an approximate 16–32 KB conceptual process budget, divided as follows:
			1.a. Text segment:   6 KB
			1.b. Data segment:   4 KB
			1.c. Stack usage:    1 KB (by design; no recursion)
			1.d. Static buffers: 2 KB total
		2. Memory model
			2.a. No heap usage
			2.b. No dynamic memory allocation
			2.c. No recursion
			2.d. All memory is static or stack-based
			2.e. All buffers are fixed-size and statically allocated

	* how to run:
		$ make
		$ # follow the order in which Brian runs the programs
